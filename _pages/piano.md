I am also an avid amateur classical pianist, and had the opportunity at MIT to perform a number of times as both a solo pianist and as part of several chamber ensembles. This was thanks to the Emerson/Harris Scholarship program and the Chamber Music Society at MIT. Most of my MIT performances are available at [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@vikramsundar), but some of my favorite performances are below:
